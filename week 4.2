# abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. our cycle is the best example ,we can start by moving leg but we cant need to know how thw cycle woeks 
''' abstraction solve the problem in the design level while the encapsulation solves the problem in the implementation level.
abstraction is used to hiding the data and giving releving data while encapsulation means hiding the code and protect from outside world.
for example: MOBILE -outer look of a mobile phone ,like it has a display screen and keypad buttons come in abstraction while inner details of a mobile phone ,how display and ketypad connect with each other come in encapsulation.'''
# The abc module in python provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs)in python .
# we can achieve the data abstraction by the using the abstract keywords for classes and interfaces.
# abstract class cannot be instantiated because it does not have a complete implementation.
